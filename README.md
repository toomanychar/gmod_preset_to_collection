# GMod preset to collection script
This is a script to quickly transfer a Garry's Mod preset into a Steam Workshop collection
# How to use this
1. Go into your Garry's Mod folder, then into garrysmod, then into settings
2. Either put from_presets.py into this folder, or copy addonpresets.txt into the folder where from_presets.py is stored
3. Run from_presets.py from the terminal, choose the preset you want to transfer into a collection
4. The small js script named into_collection.js has now been created. Go into Steam from the browser
5. Make a new collection or edit an already existing one
6. Make sure you are in the "Add / Edit Child Items" menu
7. Remove any addons from this collection to avoid problems with the script
8. Open the javascript console
9. Copy the contents of into_collection.js into the console and press Enter
10. Now you have added all the enabled addons from your preset into the chosen collection. You can save it now.
